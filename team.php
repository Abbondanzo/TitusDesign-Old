		<h4>About Bryce...</h4>
		<p>I have been developing with HTML & CSS for about 4 years now. I started tinkering on websites my Dad told me I should sign up for. I fell in love with coding, developing, and graphic design. Then one day Peter and I wanted to make this more than just our hobby. We created Titus. Whenever I am not working for Titus, I am probably at the gym or running preparing myself for the United States Marine Corps. which is my career I also want to persue in the coming years.</p>

		<h4>About Peter...</h4>
		<p>I have been developing since I was 9, working my way up from Bootstrap. Since then, I have involved myself with everything computers; from designing graphics to producing small backyard films. I came to appreciate web developing and later decided to turn this hobby into a profession, founding Titus Design at the age of 17. When I'm not responding to fire calls, I spend my free time developing or finishing my basement. </p>

		<h4>About Nick...</h4>
		<p>I have been expanding my business experience in any way possible, taking advantage of any opportunity that comes my way. When Peter and Bryce presented me with an opportunity to help out at Titus, I knew something special was happening here. Hard work and perseverance has always been an essential part of expanding my skills and knowledge. I’ve done this by earning the rank of Eagle Scout, winning debate tournaments, and even working as a Barista for a café in a hospital. When I’m not making coffee or helping out at Titus, you could probably find me watching soccer, skiing, or even just sitting by a fire with my friends, enjoying life’s simplest pleasures.</p>

		<h4>About Matthew...</h4>
		<p>I have been working in customer service and sales for four years. I was excited to take up the opportunity working with Peter and the rest of the team when he came to me in the beginning of 2016. I knew that Titus needed someone with my expertise, and I've been able to provide that and more. When I'm not out meeting with clients, I spend my extra time volunteering for the local fire department and boy scout troop. I am also an ROTC member thanks to the leadership opportunities I have taken over the last decade.</p>
